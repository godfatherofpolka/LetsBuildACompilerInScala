# Let's Build A Compiler (in Scala)

Detailled version to follow....

For now:
This is an attempt at adapting [Let's Build A Compiler (in Haskell)](https://github.com/alephnullplex/cradle/tree/master/src/Cradle) to Scala. The former is in turn based on [Let's Build A Compiler](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/).

Note: This work is very incomplete so far, and I'm not sure when I will have time to pick it up again to complete. But feel free to do whatever you feel like with it!
